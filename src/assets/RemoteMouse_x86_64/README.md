# Remote Mouse for Linux
Remote Mouse is a software that allows you to turn your mobile phone or tablet into a wireless mouse, keyboard, and trackpad for your Linux device. 
It has been tested and works well on Ubuntu versions 16 to 22 and SteamDeck, and may also work on other Linux distributions such as Debian. 
If you encounter any issues or have any feedback, you can contact the developer at support@remotemouse.net.

## Installation
Open the terminal and run the install.sh file as the root user.

## Usage
* Run 'RemoteMouse' binary!
* If you are using Ubuntu 22 and encounter a GLib-GIO-ERROR or similar error message when starting the software, follow these steps to resolve the issue:
* Go to the login-screen (just log off). You'll find settings in the lower right corner.
* Switch to "Ubuntu on XOrg" and then login again.

## Limitations
The Linux version of Remote Mouse does not support the application launcher feature and the clipboard support is limited to text only.
